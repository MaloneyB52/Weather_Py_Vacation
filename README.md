# Weather_Py_Vacation

## Project Overview

In this project, we made some enhancements to our PlanMyTrip app to include a weather description. By adding in data with the weather description, we'll use coding to create input statements and allow the user to filter the locations based off of a "min" and "max" temperature. Once we have use preferred weather filter, we'll be able to list all cities and recommend a hotel that's nearby. To test all of this, we'll be selecting four cities from the list of potential travel destinations and create a travel itinerary. Then we'll use the Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four cities.

## Results

This is the four-city itinerary that we came up with. All four of these cities are located in Brazil and we're able to access them by driving to them all
